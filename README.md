## The Objective
Code along with a Scrimba course and build a workin blackjack app!

## What I Learned
JavaScript is only difficult because there's so much to remember, but once you understand what it does, it sticks with you.

## The Challenge

### Build a Working Blackjack Game Power by JavaScript


The **JavaScript** learning on this Scrimba lesson is fantastic. I will be giving it another run through because I believe the way it's taught will cement the knowledge into my head with another pass.

## My Conlusion

A fun project which made the learning part easy to comprehend.
